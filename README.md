# Data Pipelining Project

## Airbnb Barcelona

### Data Analytics Bootcamp @ Ironhack

#### Disclaimer:

This project's results are intended to be part of a larger research.
Please refer to the following Powerpoint presentation.

### First: Choosing a subject and asking questions

The main goal of this project is to answer relevant questions about the current status of Airbnb accommodation in Barcelona, in the year 2022.

This project makes use of different Python libraries for cleaning, processing and transforming dataframes.
Also downloads data through API.
Once the data is ready, it is visualized to provide with insights to answer the questions that drive this analysis.


### Second: Collecting the data
Dowloaded the main database for this project from Inside Airbnb

http://insideairbnb.com/data-requests

This is a project centered in studying and providing data for topics as:

regulations to protect housing
impact on housing
impact on residential communities
touristification and overtourism
gentrification
unethical tech companies


### Third: Data Cleaning

Cleaned different columns, although the database was solid and very well organized.

Checking the ratio of missing data
Dropping null values
Checking and Converting data types
Checking for duplicates

Python methods, as well as Pandas Library.

### Fourth: Data Processing

The data was transformed by extracting new subsets.
Pivot tables were created, aggregating by different basic statistic methods.
Count
Sum
Mean
Median
Max
Min

Pandas library was the main tool here.


### Fifth: Data Analysis

The analysis was performed by comparing values from different attributes.
Focusing on the original questions was key to staying on track.

Running tests to see the results with Python code.


### Sixth: Data Visualization

The process to visualize was the final step in order to achieve thorough interpretation of the data ralationships.

Plotly, Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries were the tools for this task.
